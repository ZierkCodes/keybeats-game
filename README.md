# KeyBeats

## ABOUT THE GAME

KeyBeats is a rhythm game, similar to Guitar Hero. Once you pick a song difficulty the objective is to hit the correct key before the note hits the bottom of the track. Now, this must be done throughout the duration of the entire song until you win but, if you miss too many you lose.

Although this is just a game that you can only play on your laptop or desktop pc, most of my inspiration came from a game called BeatSaber which is a VR game. BeatSaber is what got me so interested in rhythm games in the first place, and I thought why not make a game like this, but doesn't make you exhausted to play it. Just to enjoy a nice challenging game with a good soundtrack while sitting down and the only controls you need are a few left clicks and the A S D F keys.

## WHAT I LEARNED

Throughout this experience, I learned that making a game of even this scale is TOUGH. With game states changing as you add to your code, makes it difficult to stay on track because debugging will be your life, and it is frustrating. I learned that it is a good idea to console.log() every function and eventListener to see where your code goes wrong when something fails to run so you can find a typo or unnecessary code easier. Also Google is a very good friend.

My fiance is a pro user experience designer and she came up with some mockups for me to use as a reference when I'm making my game's user interface. She told me that I got every UI to be pixel perfect and when I completed this I realized how good I was at working with a designer and how detail oriented I was.
